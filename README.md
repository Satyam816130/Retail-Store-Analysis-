Retail Store Performance Analysis | Power BI & DAX

In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze retail store performance across various regions. Leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I created dynamic measures and visualizations to uncover key business insights.

Key Highlights:

Top 5 Best-Performing Subcategories: Identified using the RANKX function to highlight subcategories with the highest revenue contribution.

Average Revenue by State: Calculated using DAX aggregation functions to compare state-wise performance.

Month-to-Date (MTD) Decline in Revenue: Implemented DAX time intelligence functions to monitor MTD trends and detect performance dips.

Top 5 States by Revenue: Derived using a custom ranking logic to visualize geographical leaders in sales.

Category-Wise Product Sales: Enabled drill-down analysis to evaluate performance across major product categories.

Rolling Sum for 2018: Applied DATESINPERIOD and CALCULATE functions to track 12-month rolling revenue trends for the year 2018.

Last Quarter Revenue: Captured with PREVIOUSQUARTER and TOTALQTD functions for quarter-over-quarter performance analysis.

Interactive Calendar Filtering: Integrated a custom calendar table to enable flexible time-based filtering and comparison.

Tools Used:

Power BI for visualization and dashboarding

DAX for advanced calculations and time intelligence

This project provided a 360-degree view of retail sales performance, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.
